Enter y value as a string: 4
Enter x for point 2: 2
Enter base for y value (e.g., 10 for decimal, 2 for binary): 2
Enter y value as a string: 111
Enter x for point 3: 3
Enter base for y value (e.g., 10 for decimal, 2 for binary): 10
Enter y value as a string: 12
Enter x for point 4: 4
Enter base for y value (e.g., 10 for decimal, 2 for binary): 4
